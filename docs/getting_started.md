# Getting Started

Once you've [installed](installation.md) the tool, you can start annotating your sports videos:

1. **Launch the application:**
    ```bash
    python osl_visualizer/main.py
    ```

2. **Open a video:**
   - Go to **File → Open Video** or use the toolbar button to load your video file.

3. **Load or create an annotation file:**
   - To annotate a new video, start adding actions directly.
   - To continue annotating, load an existing OSL JSON annotation file.

4. **Begin annotating:**
   - Use the playback controls and timeline to navigate your video.
   - Click “Add Annotation” to mark an action.
   - Edit timestamps and action labels as needed.

5. **Save your work:**
   - Save your annotations to an OSL-compatible JSON file via **File → Save Annotations**.

For a full walkthrough, see the [User Guide](gui_overview.md).
