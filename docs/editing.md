# Editing Annotations

You can edit any annotation by:

- Clicking its timestamp to adjust the start/end time
- Editing the action label (e.g., "header", "goal", etc.)
- Deleting annotations you no longer need

Edits are immediately reflected in the annotation list.  
Remember to **save** your changes!

**Tip:** Use [Keyboard Shortcuts](shortcuts.md) for quick editing.
