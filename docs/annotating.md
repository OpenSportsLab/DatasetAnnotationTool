# Annotating Actions

1. **Play or scrub through the video** to find the action of interest.
2. **Click "Add Annotation"** (or use the shortcut key) when the action starts or ends.
3. **Edit the timestamp or label** directly in the annotation list (right panel).
4. **Repeat** for each action you want to annotate.

- To change an annotation, select it in the list and edit the timestamp or label.
- To remove an annotation, select and click "Delete".

All changes can be saved to an OSL JSON file.

See [Editing Annotations](editing.md) for advanced editing tips.
